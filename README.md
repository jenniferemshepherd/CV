#### Disciplined
In May 2016 I was approached to take a charity place in RideLondon (100 miles).  I took up road cycling and began training; I joined Islington Cycle Club to find a community to learn with. 6 weeks later I had ridden coast-to-coast (Morecambe -> Bridlington, 175miles). So far I've ridden track at the Olympic Velodrom, several Tour de France climbs, Manchester -> London, London -> Amsterdam and many other epic climbs in Spain and the High Tatras, all self-supported.  In December 2016 I won the club award for **Most Improved Rider**.
