## Jennifer Shepherd

I am a full stack Ruby developer.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Eager Learner
I adore learning and growing in my understanding and ability.  In the last few years I have explored cycling, creative writing, coding, .  Whilst teaching I was always researching and trying new strategies, from making time gains through efficient resource distribution or making *them* think more through peer assessment.
I do weekly strength and conditioning work and the first step fascinates me: develop my neurological pathways to learn how to perform physical movements properly.  My proficiency improves faster from this than any muscle growth.

#### Excellent Verbal Communicator

Whilst teaching I honed the ability to ask questions that would tease out misconceptions from my students and clarify the direction their learning needed to take next (and thus what was required of me).  I loved finding innovative ways to communicate an idea or subject content and encouraged students in their oracy.  I developed modules that developed talk by scaffolding speech through the use of connectives and other grammatical tools.  During this time I really critiqued my own communication and assessed the devices I use to ensure clarity for those listening.  I needed to make choices in .

#### Excellent Written Communicator

DBAW course

#### Disciplined
In May 2016 I was approached to take a charity place in RideLondon (100 miles).  I took up road cycling and began training; I joined Islington Cycle Club to find a community to learn with. 6 weeks later I had ridden coast-to-coast (Morecambe -> Bridlington, 175miles). So far I've ridden track at the Olympic Velodrom, several Tour de France climbs, Manchester -> London, London -> Amsterdam and many other epic climbs in Spain and the High Tatras, all self-supported.  In **December 2016** I won the club award for **Most Improved Rider**.
