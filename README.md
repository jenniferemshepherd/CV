I'm obsessed with learning and strive to find the most effective and efficient ways in which to do so. I've challenged myself in both respects whilst as a teacher for 8 years and most recently through Makers Academy, learning the full stack.  I was selected as a Fellowship student from a competitive field and I'm excited to explore this new industry having learned from such a progressive workplace at Makers.  I'm looking for a role where I can get stuck in, contribute to an open, positive culture and collaborate with others to produce excellent products.

## Skills

#### *Maths and Logic*
I have a strong mathematical background, both graduating with a first class Maths undergraduate and as a Maths teacher with over 8 years experience. I enjoy the logical challenges that coding presents.
#### *Eager Learner:*
I love reflecting and improving.  It might be writing cleaner code or finding better ways to communicate amongst team members. Challenges provide me with opportunities to learn and I relish the ensuing growth.  In my most recent project, Dawn, my team overcame some significant obstacles by [continuously reflecting on our practice](https://medium.com/@dawnmakersacademy/to-mob-or-not-to-mob-52f16e82bc2e).
#### *Communication:*
8 years of teaching deepened my ability to interact effectively with a variety of audiences: students, parents and colleagues alike. I honed the ability to ask questions that would tease out misconceptions from my students and clarify the direction their learning needed to take next (and thus what was required of me).  I loved finding innovative ways to communicate an idea or subject content and encouraged students in their oracy.  I further developed these skills whilst pair programming at Makers where I encouraged giving and receiving feedback. I thoroughly enjoyed manipulating language in a persuasive and captivating way through a part-time creative writing course undertaken in late 2017.
#### *Disciplined:*
In May 2016 I was asked to cycle RideLondon (100 miles) less than 3 months later.  I took up road cycling and began training; I joined Islington Cycle Club to learn with a community and maintain the motivation and discipline needed to reach the fitness required. Early starts, countless steep hill reps and a lot of patience and self-encouragement meant that within 6 weeks I had cycled coast-to-coast (Morecambe -> Bridlington, 175miles). I've now ridden on the track at the Olympic Velodrome, several Tour de France climbs, from Manchester -> London and from London -> Amsterdam, all self-supported.  In December 2016 I won the club award for **Most Improved Rider**.

| Project              | Summary     | Technologies  | Testing |
| -------------------- |-------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. dawn ([Github](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/dawn)) | Final Project: A procedurally-generated socio-genetic simulation ([huh?](https://medium.com/@dawnmakersacademy/final-project-day-2-a74065a51441)) | Javascript, Matter.js, p5 | Jasmine |
| 2. jennifer.js ([Github](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/jennifer.js))| We built our own testing framework with only simple JavaScript | JavaScript, basic http-server | jennifer.js test framework (modelled on jasmine.js) |
| 3. Makers B'n'B ([Github](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/strength-bnb))| Air BnB clone: First team project which drew together all the skills we have learned so far.  My (un)willingness to give feedback was tested! | Ruby, HTML/CSS, Datamapper, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Selenium-Webdriver, Bcrypt | RSpec, Capybara |
| 4. Bowling Challenge in Javascript ([Github](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/bowling-challenge))| Interactive bowling scorecard: My favourite weekend challenge because it really forced me to think.  An ongoing exploration of javascript, testing and OO... | Javascript | Jasmine |
| 5. Boris Bikes in Ruby ([Github](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/Boris-Bikes-Day-3)) | My first 3 days of coding at Makers academy... I've come a long way but I'm still proud of this! |Ruby | RSpec |


## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2017 - March 2018)
- Curious about code: I continued working on weekend projects beyond their deadline to consolidate my knowledge, understanding and application of what we had learned.
- Fast, independent learner: proactive in learning what was needed for each project at makers within the given timeframe; weekend challenge deadlines met punctually
- Great collaborator: experienced in pair programming and delivering/receiving feedback
- Agile/XP - especially courage and communication
- Meticulous Test Driven Developer
- OOP, MVC
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Graduate Teacher Programme (2009-10) : ITT at The Latymer School, Edmonton

#### Nottingham University (2006-2009) : Maths with Statistics BSc (First Class Hons)

## Experience

**Alexandra Park School** (2010-2017)    
Maths Teacher i/c Teaching & Learning

I led research on innovative teaching and learning methods, developing the in-house CPD programme and staff learning intranet, delivered coordinated district-wide staff training, mentored students to foster a 'growth mindset', and overhauled the Performance Management System to bring it in line with best practice.

_Key skills: team leading, public speaking, time management, presenting, questioning_
